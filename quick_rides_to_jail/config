# Place quick_rides_to_jail.py in pwnagotchi/plugins/default/ 
# Add the following to your config, substituting variables as you see fit:
main:
    plugins:
      quick_rides_to_jail:
        enabled: true
        wordlist_folder: /opt/wordlists/
        net_device_path: /sys/class/net/
        interface: wlan0
        wpa_supplicant_conf_path: /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

# Again, the interface needs to be a free network interface that's not in monitor mode.
# Does not work if the quickdic plugin is enabled (since they do essentially the same things).
