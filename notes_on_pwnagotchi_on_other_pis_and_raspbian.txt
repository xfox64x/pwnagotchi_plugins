Physical Setup:
  My current development setup is a Raspberry Pi 4 running a standard Raspbian installation with two USB devices: 
  an Alfa AWUS036NHA B/G/N wireless adapter and a GlobalSat BU-353-S4 GPS receiver. An optional GSM Pi HAT occasionally 
  makes an appearance. The Pi is attached to a RAVPower 26,800mAh portable charger (battery pack), which is attached to a
  NorthPada 5v 3A micro-USB power supply charger. The power supply charger stays plugged into the input of the battery pack, 
  so I can quickly and descretly pull out the wall-wart and charge, without disrupting the operating state of the Pi. My 
  active Pi switches between existing in the nude and sitting in a SmartPi Touch case, with a 7" touchscreen display, so I 
  can interact with it on the go. Keyboard and mouse also included. All of this garbage sits inside of a OGIO backpack, with
  the stupid-long 14.75" 9dBi Alfa antenna sticking out one of the deeper pockets. The GPS dongle is usually in one of the 
  higher pockets or occasionally wired through one of the headphone-jack/accessibility-port holes, to minimize any 
  interference. The Pi chills in a completely separate, insulated pocket, with absolutely no ventilation, and I'm surprised 
  my goodest boy hasn't desoldered itself yet. Doesn't matter - captured handshakes. Everything in all of the pockets is wired 
  together by cables that pass on the outside of the bag, through accessibility ports and zipper holes. I'm real tempted to 
  poke holes on the inside of the bag, and route everything on the inside, BUT THESE BAGS ARE TOO DAMN NICE TO RUIN!

Software Setup:
  Installed Raspbian lite, then manually installed the desktop environment so I could switch between the two, depending on what 
  I was doing that day. Installed a bunch of tools, configured the environment the way I like, etc.
  
  Let's talk about the Pwnagotchi installation/config instructions: https://pwnagotchi.ai/installation/
First things first:
  "apt-get install golang git build-essential libpcap-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev gpsd gpsd-clients libatlas-base-dev libhdf5-dev libjasper-dev libqtgui4 libqt4-test python3-mpi4py python3-numpy tcpdump"
    
### Next, install bettercap using the programming language no one asked for:
  go get -u github.com/bettercap/bettercap
  sudo bettercap -eval "caplets.update; ui.update; quit"

### Edit /usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/pwnagotchi-auto.cap :

### Edit /usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/pwnagotchi-manual.cap :

### For some reason, I found it necessary to add the "LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libatomic.so.1.2.0" to keep things working with pwnagotchi. Don't know, don't care; fixed.

### Permission everything as expected:

chmod 755 /usr/bin/monstop
chmod 755 /usr/bin/bettercap-launcher
chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/bettercap.service

### Copy the default config as the working config:
cp /etc/pwnagotchi/default.yml /etc/pwnagotchi/config.yml

### Edit the working config as you see fit, though some values should stay in /etc/pwnagotchi/config.yml:

### Enable the service stubs we created:
systemctl enable pwngrid-peer.service
systemctl enable bettercap.service
systemctl enable pwnagotchi.service

### The order of the services starting (per how we configured them) is:
# pwngrid-peer.service
#         \/
# bettercap.service
#         \/
# pwnagotchi.service

### Now we can either start the services manually or reboot:
systemctl start pwngrid-peer.service
systemctl start bettercap.service
systemctl start pwnagotchi.service

### Stop all pwnagotchi services:
systemctl stop pwngrid-peer.service
systemctl stop bettercap.service
systemctl stop pwnagotchi.service

### Disable all pwnagotchi services from starting on reboot:
systemctl disable pwngrid-peer.service
systemctl disable bettercap.service
systemctl disable pwnagotchi.service

### Check your usual log locations and /var/log/pwnagotchi.log for issues starting.
### If you want to run them all manually, open up three root terminals and do:
# Terminal 1
monstart

# Terminal 3
